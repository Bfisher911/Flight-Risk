# The Era of FPV is Here

First Person View (FPV) drones have revolutionized how we perceive flight. Unlike traditional "camera drones" (like DJI Mavics) that fly themselves, FPV drones put **you** in the cockpit. You wear goggles that stream a live video feed from the drone's nose directly to your eyes.

It's fast. It's immersive. And it's incredibly technical.

> **Note:** This guide covers the "Analog" and "HDZero" systems primarily used in micro-drones, also known as "Tiny Whoops".

## What is a Tiny Whoop?

A Tiny Whoop is a micro FPV drone, typically 65mm or 75mm in diagonal size. They are:
1.  **Safe**: Ducted propellers mean you can crash into people or walls without damage.
2.  **Durable**: They can survive hundreds of crashes.
3.  **Agile**: Perfect for flying indoors or in small parks.

### Key Components of a Build

If you're using our [Drone Configurator](/part-picker), you'll see these main categories:

#### 1. The Frame
The skeleton of your drone. For beginners, the **Meteor65 Pro** frame is the gold standard. It fits larger 35mm props for more thrust but keeps the compact 65mm footprint.

#### 2. Motors
Brushless motors have replaced the old brushed ones. Look for `0802SE` style motors.
-   **19,500KV**: Balanced for flight time. Perfect for indoor racing.
-   **23,000KV**: High performance. For outdoor freestyle.

#### 3. Flight Controller (AIO)
The brain. In whoops, we use "All-In-One" (AIO) boards that combine the Flight Controller (FC), Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC), and radio Receiver (RX) onto a single board. The **F4 1S 12A AIO** is a robust choice.

#### 4. FPV Camera & VTX
-   **Camera**: Captures the video. The **C03** is lightweight and sharp.
-   **VTX (Video Transmitter)**: Beams the video to your goggles. The **M03** can output up to 350mW, punching through walls easily.

## Getting Started: The Pilot's Path

1.  **Buy a Controller (Radio)**: Don't buy a drone yet. Buy a distinct radio like the Radiomaster Pocket.
2.  **Simulators**: Download *Liftoff* or *Velocidrone*. Practice for 10 hours. If you can fly there, you can fly real life.
3.  **Buy Your First Whoop**: We recommend a pre-built Bind-N-Fly (BNF) or acquiring a custom system from our [Shop](/shop).

## Why Build Instead of Buy?

Repairability. You *will* crash. If you built it, you know how to fix it. Our [Part Picker](/part-picker) ensures you select compatible parts for your first build.
