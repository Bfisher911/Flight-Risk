The Pocket respects your logistics; it slides into a cargo pant pocket or the side sleeve of a bag, living right next to your keys. It runs EdgeTX, meaning it speaks the same language as the big radios, just with a form factor that doesn't scream \"I am doing something technical.\"\n\nOPERATIONAL NOTES:\nERGONOMICS: The gimbals are removable. If you have hands the size of catcher's mitts, you might cramp up after three packs. For everyone else, it\u2019s plenty.\nDURABILITY: High. It\u2019s built like a glorious plastic brick. Throw it in the bag; it\u2019ll be fine."
